 <h1>Adventures In Photography</h1>
 <P> I have been consistently working with photography for the past 6 years, Independently and for businesses.  I have been working for The Brock Press for the past year and a half and I have noticed significant improvement in my skills.
 I have also been exposed to a wider range of photography that I previously didn't have experience with, sports
 in particular. In the past I mainly photographed bands but I more recently have a growing appreciation for sport photography. Of everything
 I have done it requires the most concentration since everything happens so fast. Portrait photography is something I am still working on, I have never been a fan of super posed studio photography. My goal
 with portraits is for them to have a natural look and capture the subjects personality.</p>
 <p>I recently picked up a Polaroid Instant camera, it's a lot of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys photography. It forces me to think about my photo before I take it, with only 8 exposures
   per roll there is no room for error (especially with the price of film). Mostly it's a lot of fun to have a physical photo instantly,
 there is also a certain quality film has to it which is difficult to replicate with a digital camera giving it a unique look. </p>

<h3>Top 5 Photography Must Haves</h3>
<ol>
      <li>An 18-135 lens</li>
      <li>50mm (prime) lens</li>
      <li>A decent camera bag (I recomend the backpack kind)</li>
      <li>Tripod</li>
      <li>70-200 lens</li>
</ol>

<p> Above are a few pieces of gear that I highly recommend having if you are photographing a wide variety of thing like me. I also recommend a
  flash but didn't include it in my list because I far prefer using natural light and where there is none the 50 Prime lens will take care of
  you. The majority of my music photography was taken with one.</p>
